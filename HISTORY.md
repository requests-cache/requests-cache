# History

## Unreleased
* Add support for regular expressions when using `urls_expire_after`

## 1.0.1 (2023-03-24)
* Ignore `Cache-Control: must-revalidate` and `no-cache` response headers with `cache_control=False`

## 1.0.0 (2023-03-01)
[See all unreleased issues and PRs](https://github.com/requests-cache/requests-cache/milestone/10?closed=1)

üïó **Expiration & headers:**
* Add support for `Cache-Control: min-fresh`
* Add support for `Cache-Control: max-stale`
* Add support for `Cache-Control: only-if-cached`
* Add support for `Cache-Control: stale-if-error`
* Add support for `Cache-Control: stale-while-error`
* Add support for `Vary`
* Revalidate for `Cache-Control: no-cache` request or response header
* Revalidate for `Cache-Control: max-age=0, must-revalidate` response headers
* Add an attribute `CachedResponse.revalidated` to indicate if a cached response was revalidated for
  the current request

‚öôÔ∏è **Session settings:**
* All settings that affect cache behavior can now be accessed and modified via `CachedSession.settings`
* Add `always_revalidate` session setting to always revalidate before using a cached response (if a validator is available).
* Add `only_if_cached` session setting to return only cached results without sending real requests
* Add `stale_while_revalidate` session setting to return a stale response initially, while a non-blocking request is sent to refresh the response
* Make behavior for `stale_if_error` partially consistent with `Cache-Control: stale-if-error`: Add support for time values (int, timedelta, etc.) in addition to `True/False`

‚öôÔ∏è **Request settings:**
* Add `only_if_cached` option to `CachedSession.request()` and `send()` to return only cached results without sending real requests
* Add `refresh` option to `CachedSession.request()` and `send()` to revalidate with the server before using a cached response
* Add `force_refresh` option to `CachedSession.request()` and `send()` to awlays make and cache a new request regardless of existing cache contents
* Make behavior for `expire_after=0` consistent with `Cache-Control: max-age=0`: if the response has a validator, save it to the cache but revalidate on use.
  * The constant `requests_cache.DO_NOT_CACHE` may be used to completely disable caching for a request

üíæ **Backends:**
* **DynamoDB**:
  * For better read performance and usage of read throughput:
    * The cache key is now used as the partition key
    * Redirects are now cached only in-memory and not persisted
    * Cache size (`len()`) now uses a fast table estimate instead of a full scan
  * Store responses in plain (human-readable) document format instead of fully serialized binary
  * Create default table in on-demand mode instead of provisioned
  * Add optional integration with DynamoDB TTL to improve performance for removing expired responses
    * This is enabled by default, but may be disabled
  * Decode JSON and text response bodies so the saved response can be fully human-readable/editable.
    May be disabled with `decode_content=False`.
* **Filesystem**:
  * The default file format has been changed from pickle to JSON
  * Decode JSON and text response bodies so the saved response can be fully human-readable/editable.
    May be disabled with `decode_content=False`.
* **MongoDB**:
  * Store responses in plain (human-readable) document format instead of fully serialized binary
  * Add optional integration with MongoDB TTL to improve performance for removing expired responses
    * Disabled by default. See 'Backends: MongoDB' docs for details.
  * Decode JSON and text response bodies so the saved response can be fully human-readable/editable.
    May be disabled with `decode_content=False`.
* **Redis**:
  * Add `ttl_offset` argument to add a delay between cache expiration and deletion
* **SQLite**:
  * Improve performance for removing expired responses with `delete()`
  * Improve performance (slightly) with a large number of threads and high request rate
  * Add `count()` method to count responses, with option to exclude expired responses (performs a fast indexed count instead of slower in-memory filtering)
  * Add `size()` method to get estimated size of the database (including in-memory databases)
  * Add `sorted()` method with sorting and other query options
  * Add `wal` parameter to enable write-ahead logging
* **SQLite, Redis, MongoDB, and GridFS**:
    * Close open database connections when `CachedSession` is used as a contextmanager, or if `CachedSession.close()` is called

‚ÜîÔ∏è **Request matching:**
* Add serializer name to cache keys to avoid errors due to switching serializers
* Always skip both cache read and write for requests excluded by `allowable_methods` (previously only skipped write)
* Ignore and redact common authentication headers and request parameters by default. This provides
  some default recommended values for `ignored_parameters`, to avoid accidentally storing common
  credentials in the cache. This will have no effect if `ignored_parameters` is already set.
* Support distinct matching for requests that differ only by a parameter in `ignored_parameters`
  (e.g., for a request sent both with and without authentication)
* Support distinct matching for requests that differ only by duplicate request params (e.g, `a=1` vs `?a=1&a=2`)

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Convenience methods:**
* Add `expired` and `invalid` arguments to `BaseCache.delete()` (to replace `remove_expired_responses()`)
* Add `urls` and `requests` arguments to `BaseCache.delete()` (to replace `delete_url()`)
* Add `older_than` argument to `BaseCache.delete()` to delete responses older than a given value
* Add `requests` argument to `BaseCache.delete()` to delete responses matching the given requests
* Add `BaseCache.contains()` method to check for cached requests either by key or by `requests.Request` object
* Add `url` argument to `BaseCache.contains()` method (to replace `has_url()`)
* Add `BaseCache.filter()` method to get responses from the cache with various filters
* Add `BaseCache.reset_expiration()` method to reset expiration for existing responses
* Add `BaseCache.recreate_keys()` method to recreate cache keys for all previously cached responses
  (e.g., to preserve cache data after an update that changes request matching behavior)
* Update `BaseCache.urls` into a method that takes optional filter params, and returns sorted unique URLs

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Response attributes and type hints:**
* Add `OriginalResponse` type, which adds type hints to `requests.Response` objects for extra attributes added by requests-cache:
  * `cache_key`
  * `created_at`
  * `expires`
  * `from_cache`
  * `is_expired`
  * `revalidated`
* `OriginalResponse.cache_key` and `expires` will be populated for any new response that was written to the cache
* Add request wrapper methods with return type hints for all HTTP methods (`CachedSession.get()`, `head()`, etc.)
* Set `CachedResponse.cache_key` attribute for responses read from lower-level storage methods
  (`items()`, `values()`, etc.)

üß© **Compatibility fixes:**
* **PyInstaller:** Fix potential `AttributeError` due to undetected imports when requests-cache is bundled in a PyInstaller package
* **requests-oauthlib:** Add support for header values as bytes for compatibility with OAuth1 features
* **redis-py:** Fix forwarding connection parameters passed to `RedisCache` for redis-py 4.2 and python <=3.8
* **pymongo:** Fix forwarding connection parameters passed to `MongoCache` for pymongo 4.1 and python <=3.8
* **cattrs:** Add compatibility with cattrs 22.2
* **python:**
  * Add tests and support for python 3.11
  * Add tests and support for pypy 3.9

ü™≤ **Bugfixes:**
* Fix usage of memory backend with `install_cache()`
* Fix an uncommon `OperationalError: database is locked` in SQLite backend
* Fix issue on Windows with occasional missing `CachedResponse.created_at` timestamp
* Add `CachedRequest.path_url` property for compatibility with `RequestEncodingMixin`
* Fix potential `AttributeError` due to undetected imports when requests-cache is bundled in a PyInstaller package
* Fix `AttributeError` when attempting to unpickle a `CachedSession` object, and instead disable pickling by raising a `NotImplementedError`
* Raise an error for invalid expiration string values (except for headers containing httpdates)
  * Previously, this would be quietly ignored, and the response would be cached indefinitely
* Fix behavior for `stale_if_error` if an error response code is added to `allowable_codes`

üì¶ **Dependencies:**
* Replace `appdirs` with `platformdirs`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Deprecations:**

The following methods are deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. The recommended
replacements are listed below. If this causes problems for you, please open an issue to discuss.
* `CachedSession.remove_expired_responses()`: `BaseCache.delete(expired=True)`
* `BaseCache.remove_expired_responses()`: `BaseCache.delete(expired=True)`
* `BaseCache.delete_url()`: `BaseCache.delete(urls=[...])`
* `BaseCache.delete_urls()`: `BaseCache.delete(urls=[...])`
* `BaseCache.has_key()`: `BaseCache.contains()`
* `BaseCache.has_url()`: `BaseCache.contains(url=...)`
* `BaseCache.keys()`: `BaseCache.responses.keys()` (for all keys), or `BaseCache.filter()` (for filtering options)
* `BaseCache.values()`: `BaseCache.responses.values()` (for all values), or `BaseCache.filter()` (for filtering options)
* `BaseCache.response_count()`: `len(BaseCache.responses)` (for all responses), or `BaseCache.filter()` (for filtering options)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Breaking changes:**

* After initialization, cache settings can only be accesed and modified via `CachedSession.settings`. Previously, some settings could be modified by setting them on either `CachedSession` or `BaseCache`. In some cases this could silently fail or otherwise have undefined behavior.
* `BaseCache.urls` has been replaced with a method that returns a list of URLs.
* DynamoDB table structure has changed. If you are using the DynamoDB backend, you will need to create a new table when upgrading to 1.0. See [DynamoDB backend docs](https://requests-cache.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/backends/dynamodb.html#dynamodb) for more details.

**Minor breaking changes:**

The following changes only affect advanced or undocumented usage, and are not expected to impact most users:
* The arguments `match_headers` and `ignored_parameters` must be passed to `CachedSession`. Previously, these could also be passed to a `BaseCache` instance.
* The `CachedSession` `backend` argument must be either an instance or string alias. Previously it would also accept a backend class.
* All serializer-specific `BaseStorage` subclasses have been removed, and merged into their respective parent classes. This includes `SQLitePickleDict`, `MongoPickleDict`, and `GridFSPickleDict`.
  * All `BaseStorage` subclasses now have a `serializer` attribute, which will be unused if set to `None`.
* The `cache_control` module (added in `0.7`) has been split up into multiple modules in a new `policy` subpackage

### 0.9.8 (2023-01-13)
* Fix `DeprecationWarning` raised by `BaseCache.urls`
* Reword ambiguous log message for `BaseCache.delete`

Backport fixes from 1.0:
* For custom serializers, handle using a cattrs converter that doesn't support `omit_if_default`
* Raise an error for invalid expiration string values (except for headers containing httpdates)

### 0.9.7 (2022-10-26)
Backport compatibility fixes from 1.0:
* **PyInstaller:** Fix potential `AttributeError` due to undetected imports when requests-cache is bundled in a PyInstaller package
* **requests-oauthlib:** Add support for header values as bytes for compatibility with OAuth1 features
* **cattrs:** Add compatibility with cattrs 22.2
* **python:** Add tests to ensure compatibility with python 3.11
* Fix `AttributeError` when attempting to unpickle a `CachedSession` object, and instead disable pickling by raising a `NotImplementedError`

Add the following for forwards-compatibility with 1.0:
* `DeprecationWarnings` to give an earlier notice for methods deprecated (not removed) in 1.0
* `requests_cache.policy` subpackage (will replace `requests_cache.cache_control` module)
* `BaseCache.contains()`
* `BaseCache.delete()`
* `BaseCache.filter()`
* `CachedSession.settings`

  * Fix race condition in filesystem backend when one thread deletes a file after it's opened but
    before it is read by a different thread
  * Fix multiple race conditions in GridFS backend

### 0.9.2 (2022-02-15)
* Fix serialization in filesystem backend with binary content that is also valid UTF-8
* Fix some regression bugs introduced in 0.9.0:
  * Add support for `params` as a positional argument to `CachedSession.request()`

## 0.6.0 (2021-04-09)
[See all issues and PRs for 0.6](https://github.com/requests-cache/requests-cache/milestone/1?closed=1)

Thanks to [Code Shelter](https://www.codeshelter.co) and [contributors](https://requests-cache.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributors.html) for making this release possible!

üïó **Expiration:**
* Cached responses are now stored with an absolute expiration time, so `CachedSession.expire_after`
  no longer applies retroactively. To reset expiration for previously cached items, see below:
* Add support for overriding original expiration in `CachedSession.remove_expired_responses()`
* Add support for setting expiration for individual requests
* Add support for setting expiration based on URL glob patterns
* Add support for setting expiration as a `datetime`
* Add support for explicitly disabling expiration with `-1` (Since `None` may be ambiguous in some cases)

üíæ **Backends:**
* **SQLite:**
  * Allow passing user paths (`~/path-to-cache`) to database file with `db_path` param
  * Add `timeout` parameter
* **All:** Make default table names consistent across backends (`'http_cache'`)

üíæ **Serialization:**

**Note:** Due to the following changes, responses cached with previous versions of requests-cache will be invalid. These **old responses will be treated as expired**, and will be refreshed the next time they are requested. They can also be manually converted or removed, if needed (see notes below).
* Add [example script](https://github.com/requests-cache/requests-cache/blob/main/examples/convert_cache.py) to convert an existing cache from previous serialization format to new one
* When running `remove_expired_responses()`, also remove responses that are invalid due to updated serialization format
* Add `CachedResponse` class to wrap cached `requests.Response` objects, which makes additional cache information available to client code
* Add `CachedHTTPResponse` class to wrap `urllib3.response.HTTPResponse` objects, available via `CachedResponse.raw`
    * Re-construct the raw response on demand to avoid storing extra data in the cache
    * Improve emulation of raw request behavior used for iteration, streaming requests, etc.
* Add `BaseCache.urls` property to get all URLs persisted in the cache
* Add optional support for `itsdangerous` for more secure serialization

**Other features:**
* Add `CacheMixin` class to make the features of `CachedSession` usable as a mixin class, for [compatibility with other requests-based libraries](https://requests-cache.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced_usage.html#library-compatibility).
* Add `HEAD` to default `allowable_methods`

üìó **Docs & Tests:**
* Add type annotations to main functions/methods in public API, and include in documentation on [readthedocs](https://requests-cache.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* Add [Contributing Guide](https://requests-cache.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributing.html), [Security](https://requests-cache.readthedocs.io/en/stable/security.html) info, and more examples & detailed usage info in [User Guide](https://requests-cache.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide.html) and [Advanced Usage](https://requests-cache.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced_usage.html) sections.
* Increase test coverage and rewrite most tests using pytest
* Add containerized backends for both local and CI integration testing

ü™≤ **Bugfixes:**
* Fix caching requests with data specified in `json` parameter
* Fix caching requests with `verify` parameter
* Fix duplicate cached responses due to some unhandled variations in URL format
* Fix usage of backend-specific params when used in place of `cache_name`
* Fix potential TypeError with `DbPickleDict` initialization
* Fix usage of `CachedSession.cache_disabled` if used within another contextmanager
* Fix non-thread-safe iteration in `BaseCache`
* Fix `get_cache()`, `clear()`, and `remove_expired_responses()` so they will do nothing if requests-cache is not installed
* Update usage of deprecated MongoClient `save()` method
* Replace some old bugs with new and different bugs, just to keep life interesting

üì¶ **Depedencies:**
* Add `itsdangerous` as a dependency for secure serialization
* Add `url-normalize` as a dependency for better request normalization and reducing duplications

‚ö†Ô∏è **Deprecations & removals:**
* Drop support for python 2.7, 3.4, and 3.5
* Deprecate `core` module; all imports should be made from top-level package instead
    * e.g.: `from requests_cache import CachedSession`
    * Imports `from requests_cache.core` will raise a `DeprecationWarning`, and will be removed in a future release
* Rename `BaseCache.remove_old_entries()` to `remove_expired_responses()`, to match its wrapper method `CachedSession.remove_expired_responses()`
