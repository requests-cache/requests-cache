* Redis: Improve performance by using native Redis TTL for cache expiration

**Other features:**
* Support `expire_after` param for `CachedSession.send()`

**Performance:**
* Fix duplicate read operation for checking whether to read from redirects cache
* Skip unnecessary contains check if a key is in the main responses cache
* Make per-request expiration thread-safe for both `CachedSession.request()` and `CachedSession.send()`

## 0.8.0 (2021-09-07)
[See all issues and PRs for 0.8](https://github.com/reclosedev/requests-cache/milestone/3?closed=1)

**Expiration & Headers:**
* Add support for conditional requests and cache validation using:
    * `ETag` + `If-None-Match` headers
    * `Last-Modified` + `If-Modified-Since` headers
    * `304 Not Modified` responses
* If a cached response is expired but contains a validator, a conditional request will by sent, and a new response will be cached and returned only if the remote content has not changed

**Backends:**
* Filesystem:
    * Add `FileCache.cache_dir` wrapper property
    * Add `FileCache.paths()` method
    * Add `use_cache_dir` option to use platform-specific user cache directory
    * Return `pathlib.Path` objects for all file paths

* Allow `match_headers` to optionally accept a list of specific headers to match
* Add support for custom cache key callbacks with `key_fn` parameter
* By default use blake2 instead of sha256 for generating cache keys
* Slightly reduce size of serialized responses

**Backwards-compatible API changes:**

The following changes are meant to make certain behaviors more obvious for new users, without breaking existing usage:
* For consistency with `Cache-Control: stale-if-error`, rename `old_data_on_error` to `stale_if_error`
  * Going forward, any new options based on a standard HTTP caching feature will be named after that feature
* For clarity about matching behavior, rename `include_get_headers` to `match_headers`
  * References in the docs to cache keys and related behavior are now described as 'request matching'
* For consistency with other backends, rename SQLite backend classes: `backends.sqlite.Db*` -> `SQLiteCache`, `SQLiteDict`, `SQLitePickleDict`
* Add aliases for all previous parameter/class names for backwards-compatibility

**Dependencies:**
* Add `appdirs` as a dependency for easier cross-platform usage of user cache directories
* Update `cattrs` from optional to required dependency
* Update `itsdangerous` from required to optional (but recommended) dependency
* Require `requests` 2.22+ and `urllib3` 1.25.5+

**Deprecations & removals:**
* Drop support for python 3.6
    * **Note:** python 3.6 support in 0.7.x will continue to be maintained at least until it reaches EOL (2021-12-23)
    * Any bugfixes for 0.8 that also apply to 0.7 will be backported
* Remove deprecated `core` module
* Remove deprecated `BaseCache.remove_old_entries()` method

## 0.6.0 (2021-04-09)
[See all issues and PRs for 0.6](https://github.com/reclosedev/requests-cache/milestone/1?closed=1)

Thanks to [Code Shelter](https://www.codeshelter.co) and [contributors](https://requests-cache.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributors.html) for making this release possible!

**Backends:**
* SQLite: Allow passing user paths (`~/path-to-cache`) to database file with `db_path` param
* SQLite: Add `timeout` parameter
* Make default table names consistent across backends (`'http_cache'`)

**Expiration:**
* Cached responses are now stored with an absolute expiration time, so `CachedSession.expire_after` no longer applies retroactively. To revalidate previously cached items with a new expiration time see below:
* Add support for overriding original expiration (i.e., revalidating) in `CachedSession.remove_expired_responses()`
* Add support for setting expiration for individual requests
* Add support for setting expiration based on URL glob patterns
* Add support for setting expiration as a `datetime`
* Add support for explicitly disabling expiration with `-1` (Since `None` may be ambiguous in some cases)

**Serialization:**
* **Note:** Due to the following changes, responses cached with previous versions of requests-cache will be invalid. These **old responses will be treated as expired**, and will be refreshed the next time they are requested. They can also be manually converted or removed, if needed (see notes below).
* Add [example script](https://github.com/reclosedev/requests-cache/blob/master/examples/convert_cache.py) to convert an existing cache from previous serialization format to new one
* When running `remove_expired_responses()`, also remove responses that are invalid due to updated serialization format
* Add `CachedResponse` class to wrap cached `requests.Response` objects, which makes additional cache information available to client code
* Add `CachedHTTPResponse` class to wrap `urllib3.response.HTTPResponse` objects, available via `CachedResponse.raw`
    * Re-construct the raw response on demand to avoid storing extra data in the cache
    * Improve emulation of raw request behavior used for iteration, streaming requests, etc.
* Add `BaseCache.urls` property to get all URLs persisted in the cache
* Add optional support for `itsdangerous` for more secure serialization

**Other features:**
* Add `CacheMixin` class to make the features of `CachedSession` usable as a mixin class, for [compatibility with other requests-based libraries](https://requests-cache.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced_usage.html#library-compatibility).
* Add `HEAD` to default `allowable_methods`

**Bugfixes:**
* Fix caching requests with data specified in `json` parameter
* Fix caching requests with `verify` parameter
* Fix duplicate cached responses due to some unhandled variations in URL format
* Fix usage of backend-specific params when used in place of `cache_name`
* Fix potential TypeError with `DbPickleDict` initialization
* Fix usage of `CachedSession.cache_disabled` if used within another contextmanager
* Fix non-thread-safe iteration in `BaseCache`
* Fix `get_cache()`, `clear()`, and `remove_expired_responses()` so they will do nothing if requests-cache is not installed
* Update usage of deprecated MongoClient `save()` method
* Replace some old bugs with new and different bugs, just to keep life interesting

**Depedencies:**
* Add `itsdangerous` as a dependency for secure serialization
* Add `url-normalize` as a dependency for better request normalization and reducing duplications

**Deprecations & removals:**
* Drop support for python 2.7, 3.4, and 3.5
* Deprecate `core` module; all imports should be made from top-level package instead
    * e.g.: `from requests_cache import CachedSession`
    * Imports `from requests_cache.core` will raise a `DeprecationWarning`, and will be removed in a future release
* Rename `BaseCache.remove_old_entries()` to `remove_expired_responses()`, to match its wrapper method `CachedSession.remove_expired_responses()`

**Docs & Tests:**
* Add type annotations to main functions/methods in public API, and include in documentation on [readthedocs](https://requests-cache.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* Add [Contributing Guide](https://requests-cache.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributing.html), [Security](https://requests-cache.readthedocs.io/en/stable/security.html) info, and more examples & detailed usage info in [User Guide](https://requests-cache.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide.html) and [Advanced Usage](https://requests-cache.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced_usage.html) sections.
* Increase test coverage and rewrite most tests using pytest
* Add containerized backends for both local and CI integration testing
