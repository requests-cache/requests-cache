"""The ``cattrs`` library includes a number of pre-configured converters that perform some
additional steps required for specific serialization formats.

This module wraps those converters as serializer :py:class:`.Stage` objects. These are then used as
a stage in a :py:class:`.SerializerPipeline`, which runs after the base converter and before the
format's ``dumps()`` (or equivalent) method.

For any optional libraries that aren't installed, the corresponding serializer will be a placeholder
class that raises an ``ImportError`` at initialization time instead of at import time.
