    requests_cache
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Transparent cache for ``requests`` library with persistence and async support

    Just write::

        import requests_cache
        requests_cache.configure()

    And requests to resources will be cached for faster repeated access::

        import requests
        for i in range(10):
            r = requests.get('http://httpbin.org/delay/5')
        # will took  approximately 5 seconds instead 50
